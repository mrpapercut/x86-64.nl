## About me
![mischa](mischa.png?resize=160 "Mischa")
I'm Mischa Rodermond, a 30-something year old software developer from the Netherlands. My main focus is on web-development, but my interests take me far beyond. On this blog you'll find snippets of code, prime numbers, OEIS sequences, and whatever keeps me busy.
